This EVD (EigenValueDecompostion) is personally implemented and it is somehow explained and mentioned in the main wrapper and other files as well.
The important thing about this implementation is that the results are reported to be the same as the results from MATLAB and OCTAVE/GNU implementations.
The reference of the implementation is MathWorks and NIST which are very reliable and responsible references.
