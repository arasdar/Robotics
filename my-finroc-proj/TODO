// sensor data fusion img, dist and loc data
This will be the final experiment --> concatenate and fusing data
PCA on img with high resolution and extracted, selected and transformation(or projection) --> reduced to important img dimension and feature afterwards
fused with loc and dist data for more accuracy and EVD and PCA find PCs and same process for intelligent control
--> fusion should bring us more accuracy in recognition

// plenty of different BIG Dimensional sensor data in the simulated platform to test for feature extraction (analysis), selection (reduction) and transform (project)
Add other sensors data such different high resolution images, laser scanners 2D and 3D to show the ability to handle big dimensionality and fusion

// mlr learning --> feature selection -- selection criteria (number of S and value of S)
the accumalative value of the selected eigenFeatures over the total values of all eigenFeatures
(S1+.................Sk)/(S1+...............+Sn)
