sudo apt-get purge/autoremove nvidia*
sudo apt-get install nvidia344-dev

This is tested one more time for Donyang's PC and GPU installation:
Installing Ubnutu16.04
sudo apt-autoremove nvidia*
sudo apt-get install nvidia346-dev

After this I installed anaconda:
conda install jupyter-notebook and tensorflow-gpu

After this, gpu was detected easily.
